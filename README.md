Hi, I’m @DStierand!
- I'm a <b>political scientist</b> and PhD student.
- I’m interested in <b>behavioral experimental research</b>.
- I’m currently honing my skills in programming <b>oTree</b> experiments (Python-based).
- When I program solutions for specific problems and cannot find anything like it in oTree snippets (https://www.otreehub.com/projects/otree-snippets/), <b>I will provide the code to the community</b> via GitHub.
- <b>Fun fact:</b> All work and no play makes @DStierand a dull boy...
